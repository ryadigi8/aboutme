I'm in my second year of Graphic Design and it's been interesting. I'm an only child and love to draw and make random thing. I have a bad habit of doodling little monsters in class but I'm getting better at it. I don't sleep well so I drink a good amount on coffee to stay up. I have a part time job so between school and work I don't have much of a life.
